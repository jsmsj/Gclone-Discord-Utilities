# If you already have a GClone Configuration file for service accounts, you can copy your configuration into the same folder as the Gclone-Discord-Utilities script and if the configuration looks like the ones above, then you can copy your service accounts on over to accounts folder!
# But if you wish to use one of the configs above, remove the #Hashtags from the config lines. YOU CAN ONLY USE ONE CONFIG AT A TIME!!! Using multiple configs with the same name will create errors and problems!!!
# Your config name must be called [GC] because that is the remote name the bot uses for your SAs!!!
