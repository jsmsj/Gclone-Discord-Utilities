# Gclone Discord Utilities
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7 or later to run this script. Below are some extra things you need to download / install too:

- **[Gclone](https://github.com/donwa/gclone)** - Run the shell / batch script if you are on Linux to install, or add the gclone.exe file to your system PATH variables if you are on Windows. Putting the script in the same directory as GClone in Windows will work as well. If you are on MacOS, download the Darwin build of GClone.
- **[AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/autorclone) - (Service accounts folder)** - GClone requires service accounts. To generate and manage them, use AutoRClone. You can then configure GClone using the service accounts.

## Setup (Windows):
1. Download the [zip](https://codeload.github.com/jsmsj/Gclone-Discord-Utilities/zip/refs/heads/main) of the repo.
2. Run `pip install virtualenv` in your terminal.
3. Activate the virtual enviorment.
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a discord bot account. Follow this [tutorial](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html), or you can refer to youtube.
6. Edit the [secrets.py](secrets.py) file.
7. Open up your Terminal or Command Line and then `cd` into the directory of the Cloned GitHub Repo.
8. Run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`. The output of the Terminal or Command Line should have no errors and show that everything is all ready!
